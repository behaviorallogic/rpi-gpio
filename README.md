Raspberry Pi GPIO Utility
=========================

This utility uses Web sockets to send a signal to a Raspberry Pi over a network to simply turn on or off voltage to GPIO pins. I find it useful for separating the testing of hardware from software.

## Installation

This application was intended as a first use of git for beginners, so I am going to attempt to be more detailed and explicit than I would normally.

Clone this repo

    git clone git@github.com:behaviorallogic/rpi-gpio.git

or

    git clone https://github.com/behaviorallogic/rpi-gpio.git

Change the directory to the repo `cd rpi-gpio` and then install the required libraries `npm install`.
